The purpose of "preplot" is to perform various data analysis tasks pertaining
to cosmological dark matter simulations, especially those analyzed using the
ROCKSTAR halo finder and CONSISTENT TREES merger tree code.

Several primary types of analysis are supported, including analysis of the
ROCKSTAR catalogs themselves, the merger trees, the halo profiles, the
voxelized densities, and the cosmic web.
